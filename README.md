As a traveler, the Weather Dashboard addresses the need to efficiently plan trips by offering a comprehensive weather outlook. By integrating the OpenWeatherMap API, the dashboard provides current and future weather conditions for cities, enabling users to make informed decisions about their travel plans, such as what to pack or which activities to schedule.

### Search Functionality:

### Current Weather Conditions:
